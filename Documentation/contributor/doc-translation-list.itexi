@c Word counts are updated automatically by translations-status.py 

Translation of @file{Documentation/foo/bar} should be
@file{Documentation/@var{LANG}/foo/bar}.  Unmentioned files should not
be translated.

Priorities:
@itemize
@item 1. delivery,
@item 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. later,
@item 7. optional.
@end itemize

Files of priority 1 should be submitted along all files generated by
starting a new language in the same commit and thus a unique patch, and
the translation of files marked with priority 2 should be committed to
Git at the same time and thus sent in a single patch.  Files
marked with priority 3 or more may be submitted individually.  Word
counts (excluding LilyPond snippets) are given for each file.  For
knowing how to commit your work to Git, then make patches of your new
translations as well as corrections and updates, see @ref{Basic Git
procedures}.
