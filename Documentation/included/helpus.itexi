@macro helpusNeed
@subheading We need you!

Thank you for your interest in helping us --- we would love to see
you get involved!  Your contribution will help a large group of users
make beautifully typeset music.

Even working on small tasks can have a big impact: taking care of
them allows experienced developers work on advanced tasks, instead
of spending time on those simple tasks.

For a multi-faceted project like LilyPond, sometimes it's tough to know
where to begin.  In addition to the avenues proposed below, you can send
an e-mail to the
@uref{https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-devel, lilypond-devel@@gnu.org}
mailing list, and we'll help you to get started.

Mailing list support: answer questions from fellow users.

@item
Bug reporting: help users create proper @rweb{Bug reports}, and/or
join the Bug Squad to organize @rcontrib{Issues}.

@item
Documentation: small changes can be proposed by following the
guidelines for @rcontrib{Documentation suggestions}.

@item
LilyPond Snippet Repository (LSR): create and fix snippets
following the guidelines in
@rcontrib{Adding and editing snippets}.

@item
Discussions, reviews, and testing: the developers often ask for
feedback about new documentation, potential syntax changes, and
testing new features.  Please contribute to these discussions!

@macro helpusAdvanced
@subheading Advanced tasks

These jobs generally require that you have the source code and can
compile LilyPond.

@warning{We suggest that contributors using Windows or MacOS X do
@strong{not} attempt to set up their own development environment;
instead, use Lilydev as discussed in @rcontrib{Quick start}.}

Contributors using Linux or FreeBSD may also use Lilydev, but if
they prefer their own development environment, they should read
@rcontrib{Working with source code}, and @rcontrib{Compiling}.

Begin by reading @rcontrib{Summary for experienced developers}.

@itemize
@item
Documentation: for large changes, see
@rcontrib{Documentation work}.

@item
Website: the website is built from the normal documentation
source.  See the info about documentation, and also
@rcontrib{Website work}.

@item
Translations: see @rcontrib{Translating the documentation}, and
@rcontrib{Translating the website}.

@item
Bugfixes or new features: read @rcontrib{Programming work}.

@subsubheading Grand LilyPond Input Syntax Standardization

Website:
@rcontrib{Grand LilyPond Input Syntax Standardization (GLISS)}.

GLISS will stabilize the (non-tweak) input syntax for the upcoming
LilyPond 3.0.  After updating to 3.0, the input syntax for
untweaked music will remain stable for the foreseeable future.

We will have an extensive discussion period to determine the final
input specification.

@warning{GLISS will start shortly after 2.16 is released.}

@subsubheading Grand Organizing Project

Website: @rcontrib{Grand Organization Project (GOP)}.

GOP will be our big recruiting drive for new contributors.  We
desperately need to spread the development duties (including
@qq{simple tasks} which require no programming or interaction with
source code!) over more people.  We also need to document
knowledge from existing developers so that it does not get lost.

Unlike most @qq{Grand Projects}, GOP is not about adding huge new
features or completely redesigning things.  Rather, it is aimed at
giving us a much more stable foundation so that we can move ahead
with larger tasks in the future.
