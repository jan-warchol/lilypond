<!--
we depend on an external entity here, which we cannot control.  Suppose
we go from 2.15.x to 2.17.x and put the documentation under "v2.17".
For some time, Google won't have the new location in its index, so the
search would get nothing.  It would be better to keep "v2.15" in the
search for a while and have a redirection from "v2.15" to "v2.17".
