When writing a figured bass, you can place the figures above or below
the bass notes, by defining the
@code{BassFigureAlignmentPositioning.direction} property (exclusively
in a @code{Staff} context).  Choices are @code{#UP} (or @code{#1}),
@code{#CENTER} (or @code{#0}) and @code{#DOWN} (or @code{#-1}).

This property can be changed as many times as you wish.  Use
@code{\\once \\override} if you don't want the override to apply to the
whole score.
