When adding a new staff at a line break, some extra space is
unfortunately added at the end of the line before the break (to fit in
a key signature change, which  will never be printed anyway).  The
workaround is to add a setting of
@code{Staff.explicitKeySignatureVisibility} as is shown in the example.
