When outputting MIDI, the default behavior is for each staff to
represent one MIDI channel, with all the voices on a staff amalgamated.
This minimizes the risk of running out of MIDI channels, since there
are only 16 available per MIDI port, and most devices support only one
port.

However, by moving the @code{Staff_performer} to the @code{Voice}
context, each voice on a staff can have its own MIDI channel, as is
demonstrated by the following example: despite being on the same staff,
two MIDI channels are created, each with a different
@code{midiInstrument}.
