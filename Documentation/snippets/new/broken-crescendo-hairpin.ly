In order to make parts of a crescendo hairpin invisible, the following
method is used: A white rectangle is drawn on top of the respective
part of the crescendo hairpin, making it invisible.

The markup command @code{with-dimensions} tells LilyPond to consider only
the bottom edge of the rectangle when spacing it against the hairpin.
The property @code{staff-padding} prevents the rectangle from fitting
between the hairpin and staff.

Make sure to put the hairpin in a lower layer than the text markup to
draw the rectangle over the hairpin.
