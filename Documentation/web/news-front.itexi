@subsubheading LilyPond 2.19.2 released  @emph{February 2, 2014}

We are happy to announce the release of LilyPond 2.19.2.  This
release includes a number of enhancements, and contains
some work in progress.  You will have access to the very latest features, but
some may be incomplete, and you may encounter bugs and crashes.  If you require
a stable version of Lilypond, we recommend using the 2.18 version.

@subsubheading Lilypond 2.18.0 released!  @emph{December 29, 2013}

We are proud to announce the release of GNU LilyPond 2.18.0.
LilyPond is a music engraving program devoted to producing the
highest-quality sheet music possible.  It brings the aesthetics of
traditionally engraved music to computer printouts.

Among the numerous improvements and changes, the following might
be most visible:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Many items are now positioned using their actual outline rather
than a@tie{}rectangular bounding box.  This greatly reduces
the occurrence of unsightly large gaps.

@item
Sets and overrides can now use the syntax
@example
\override Voice.TextSpanner.bound-details.left.text = "rit."
@end example
instead of the previous
@example
\override Voice.TextSpanner #'(bound-details left text) = "rit."
@end example

@item
Triplets with a given group length can now be written as
@example
\tuplet 3/2 4 @{ c8 c c  c c c @}
@end example
instead of
@example
\times 2/3 @{ c8 c c @}  \times 2/3 @{ c8 c c @}
@end example
@end itemize

A full list of noteworthy new features is given in:

@example

Great thanks go to the large number of LilyPond enthusiasts whose
financial backing enabled one core developer, David Kastrup, to
focus exclusively on LilyPond during the entire development cycle.
