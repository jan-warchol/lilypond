  Slope is self-explanatory.  Shape determines wheteher slashes look like
  rectangles or like very small beams.  Setting this properties directly
  causes all slashes behave in the specified way.  However, one usually
  wants the slashes to behave differently depending on wheter the note
  has flags, beams or only a plain stem.  That's what style property
  is used for: it sets shape and slope depending on situation.
  There are two styles defined: default and constant."
